# Monitoring <TierLabel tiers="Enterprise" />

Weave GitOps Enterprise provides the following telemetry and tooling for monitoring:
- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Profiling](#profiling)

## Setup

The following configuration options are available for you to configure `montoring`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: weave-gitops-enterprise
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  values:
    monitoring:
      enabled: true # enable it if you want to expose a monitoring server
      service:
        name: monitoring
        port: 8080 # port to expose the monitoring server
      metrics:
        enabled: true # enable it to expose a prometheus metrics endpoint in `/metrics`
      profiling:
        enabled: false # enable it to expose a pprof debug endpoint  `/debug/pprof`
```

:::caution
The monitoring server holds private services, so you likely do not require to expose beyond your cluster. In
case you need, ensure that it is properly secured.
:::

## Metrics

It generates [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics for monitoring both performance and business operations.

### Get Started

:::info
This setup follows [Flux Monitoring](https://fluxcd.io/flux/monitoring/metrics/) approach based on [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/). Adapt it to your context as needed.
:::

1. You have [enabled](#setup) the monitoring server with the metrics endpoint.
2. Install [Kube Prometheus Stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack).

**Explorer**

Monitor Explorer golden signals. More info [here](../../explorer/operations#monitoring)

## Profiling

Profiling can be useful during operations to help you to gain a deeper understanding, of how weave gitops runtime behaves.
Given Weave GitOps is written in Go, profiling happens through [pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof), and it is
exposed as web endpoint by [pprof http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof).


#### Get Started

1. You have [enabled](#setup) the monitoring server with the profiling endpoint.
2. Navigate to your monitoring server URL to the `/debug/pprof` path where the pprof web interface is exposed.
