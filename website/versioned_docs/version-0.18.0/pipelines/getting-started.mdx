# Getting started with pipelines <TierLabel tiers="Enterprise" />

## Requirements
:::tip Feature toggle
The Pipelines feature can be enabled or disabled by setting the `enablePipelines`
flag in the values for the Weave GitOps Enterprise Helm Chart.
:::

- You have configured Weave GitOps Enterprise [RBAC for pipelines](../authorization)

## Define a pipeline

A pipeline allows you to define the route your application is taking in order to make it to production.
There are three main concepts playing in a pipeline:
- the `application` to deliver
- the `environments` that your app will go through in its way to production (general)
- the `deployment targets` or the clusters that each environment has

You can define a delivery pipeline using a `Pipeline` custom resource.
An example of how it looks for an application `podinfo` is shown below.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: pipelines.weave.works/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: podinfo-02
  namespace: default
spec:
  appRef:
    apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
    kind: HelmRelease
    name: podinfo
  environments:
    - name: dev
      targets:
        - namespace: podinfo-02-dev
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: dev
            namespace: flux-system
    - name: test
      targets:
        - namespace: podinfo-02-qa
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: dev
            namespace: flux-system
        - namespace: podinfo-02-perf
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: dev
            namespace: flux-system
    - name: prod
      targets:
        - namespace: podinfo-02-prod
          clusterRef:
            kind: GitopsCluster
            name: prod
            namespace: flux-system
```

</details>

In the previous example, `podinfo` application is delivered to a traditional pipeline composed by `dev`, `qa`, `perf` and `production` environments.
Each environment is backed by a `GitopsCluster` [deployment target](../../cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters/).

For more details about the spec of a pipeline [see here](spec/v1alpha1/pipeline.mdx)

## View the list of pipelines

Once flux has created your pipeline you can navigate to the pipelines view to see it.

![view pipelines](img/view-pipelines.png)

Pipeline list view show the list of pipelines you have access to. For each pipeline, a simplified view of the pipeline
is shown with the application `Type` and `Environments` it goes through.

## View the details of a pipeline

Once you have selected a pipeline from the list, you will navigate to its details view.
In pipeline details view you could view the current status of your application by environment and deployment
target.
