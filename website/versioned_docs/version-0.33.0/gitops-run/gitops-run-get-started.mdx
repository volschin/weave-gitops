# Get Started with GitOps Run

GitOps Run supports two different modes of operation - directly on a
cluster or as sandboxed sessions. The sandboxed sessions are intended
for shared environments where multiple users are running their own
sessions, whereas the direct mode is intended for a local cluster.

In this tutorial we are going to use 'direct mode' to run GitOps on a local
cluster.


## Prerequisites
### Required
- Install the GitOps CLI. See [the installation](../open-source/getting-started/install-OSS.mdx#install-the-gitops-cli).

### Optional
- This guide uses [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) for demonstrations, but it is not required to use GitOps Run
- The [Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/) is the quickest way to generate resource definitions, but the files can also be created manually

## Create a Local Kubernetes Cluster

To get started with GitOps Run, you need a Kubernetes cluster. There
are many tools to set up a local cluster for test and development
purposes.

:::note
This tutorial assumes you have full control of your cluster - we
recommend a local cluster, but you can also use a remote cluster where
you have full `cluster-admin` privileges.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kind">

Install [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) and run

```bash
kind create cluster
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k3d">

Install [k3d](https://k3d.io/) and run

```bash
k3d cluster create mycluster
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="minikube">

Install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) and run

```bash
minikube start
```

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and enable Kubernetes. Then run

```
kubectl config set-context docker-desktop
```
</TabItem>

GitOps Run works on any Kubernetes platform, but to avoid accidents
you have to explicitly white-list the context name.

First, find the name of the context where you want to run `gitops beta run` - in this example, there's a cluster with the name "dev":

```bash
$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                      CLUSTER                   AUTHINFO                  NAMESPACE
*         dev                       dev                       dev
```

Then, for any `gitops beta run` command in this guide, you'll have to add the flag `--allow-k8s-context=dev`
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Before you continue, make sure `kubectl get nodes` returns a node which is `Ready`.

## Create a GitOps Repository

You need to set up a Git repository to put your GitOps manifests
in. Any Git repository will do, for example create a new
[github](https://github.com/new) repository and clone that.

You may alternatively fork an existing repository, as we have done for this guide. Head
to [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo) and create a fork with the
name `podinfo-gitops-run`.

## Set up GitOps Run

To start GitOps Run, clone your newly created repository or fork and change into
it.

We will run the command with `--no-session` as it's a single user
cluster which we want to use in direct mode. The port-forward points
at the `podinfo` pod we will create later on.

```bash
export GITHUB_USER=<your github username>

# you can ignore these two commands if you already created and cloned your repository
git clone git@github.com:$GITHUB_USER/podinfo-gitops-run.git

cd podinfo-gitops-run
gitops beta run ./podinfo --no-session --port-forward namespace=dev,resource=svc/dev-podinfo,port=9898:9898
```

You will now be asked if you want to install Flux and the GitOps
[dashboard](../intro-weave-gitops.mdx). Answer `yes` and **set a password**.

:::tip
If you do not set a password, you won't be able to login to the GitOps UI
:scream:.
:::

Shortly after you should be able to [open the dashboard](http://localhost:9001).
The username is `admin` and the password will be the one you set above.

In your dashboard you will be able to see what is in your cluster, including
the resources that GitOps Run is operating.

## Start Modifying Your Deployment

In your local GitOps repo, you will see that GitOps Run has created a new
directory called `podinfo`. Inside there is a single, mostly empty, `kustomization.yaml`.

To create the automation for the `podinfo` app, we first have to add the resources to
run it - we'll create a new `Namespace`, a `HelmRepository` that
references the Helm repository where the manifests are stored, and a
`HelmRelease` that references the chart and version. We can use the
`flux` CLI to generate the resource definition, or we can just create
the yaml files ourselves.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="flux">

```bash
cat <<EOF > ./podinfo/namespace.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
EOF
flux create source helm podinfo --url=https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo --namespace=dev --export > ./podinfo/podinfo-source.yaml
flux create helmrelease podinfo --source=HelmRepository/podinfo --chart=podinfo --export --namespace=dev --target-namespace=dev > ./podinfo/podinfo-helmrelease.yaml
```

You should see three files now exist in your `./podinfo` directory.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml">

Save the contents of the following files to the `./podinfo` directory.

<details><summary>./podinfo/namespace.yaml</summary>

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
```

</details>

<details><summary>./podinfo/podinfo-source.yaml</summary>

```yaml
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: dev
spec:
  interval: 1m0s
  url: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
```

</details>

<details><summary>./podinfo/podinfo-helmrelease.yaml</summary>

```yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: dev
spec:
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: podinfo
      reconcileStrategy: ChartVersion
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: podinfo
  interval: 1m0s
  targetNamespace: dev
```

</details>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The only remaining step is to import these files in the auto-generated
`kustomization.yaml`. Open it up, and you should see the following:

```yaml title="./podinfo/kustomization.yaml"
---
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources: [] # ðŸ‘‹ Start adding the resources you want to sync here
```

Change the last line so it instead looks like the following:

```yaml title="./podinfo/kustomization.yaml"
---
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
// highlight-start
resources:
  - namespace.yaml
  - podinfo-source.yaml
  - podinfo-helmrelease.yaml
// highlight-end
```

GitOps Run should now automatically upload these manifests and install
them. The dashboard should show you how the resources are being
reconciled, and when they're Ready you will be able to see podinfo
[here](http://localhost:9898).


## Update Your App

Now that GitOps Run is continuously watching and reconciling your
local files onto your cluster, we can start modifying the resources.

We're going to be modifying the `podinfo` we set up in the previous
step. Open the current [podinfo](http://localhost:9898) and pay
attention to the background color.

Now, open your HelmRelease file and add the values at the bottom, as
indicated:

```yaml title="./podinfo/podinfo-helmrelease.yaml"
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: dev
spec:
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: podinfo
      reconcileStrategy: ChartVersion
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: podinfo
  interval: 1m0s
  targetNamespace: dev
// highlight-start
  values:
    ui:
      color: "#C32148"
// highlight-end
```

When you hit save, you'll see GitOps Run upload new files, and once
it's reconciled the `podinfo` background will have been changed to a bright red.

## Troubleshooting Tips

Tips originate from issues reported by GitOps Run users. Experience a problem? [Report it here](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/issues).

**GitOps Run failed on macOS using a local [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.6.0/) cluster, can't mount `/etc/machine-id`**

[Reported by a community user](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/issues/3956) who found a workaround and shared it:

Update your [k3d config file](https://k3d.io/v5.6.0/usage/configfile/) to include the following section:

```yaml
volumes:
  - volume: /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id
    nodeFilters:
      - server:*
      - agent:*
```

## Next Steps: GitOps Mode

Now that we've used this interactive environment to set up the
resources we want, we can switch over to full GitOps mode, where Flux
is permanently pulling from your remote Git repository.

Hit `ctrl-c` to stop GitOps Run. It will ask you whether you want to bootstrap
your cluster into full GitOps mode. If you answer yes, it
will take you through a wizard to help you set this up. You'll need information
such as the remote repository, the branch name, etc.

When you hit submit, it will set up the repository and branch, add
Flux manifests, as well as the files you were just working on. From
this point on, you can make persistent changes by pushing them to this
repository.
