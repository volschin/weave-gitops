**To run this example you will need extra RBAC**

This particular example creates kustomizations, so you will need to add the below RBAC
to the `gitopssets-controller-manager` service account to allow it to create kustomizations.

Check out the [Security](./intro.mdx#security) section for more information.

**However this will change in the next release with impersonation. Instead you can choose a service account
for each `GitOpsSet` that has the required permissions for creating the rendered resources in the
`templates` section.**

Additional RBAC for the `gitopssets-controller-manager` service account:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: demo-role
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io
  resources:
  - kustomizations
  verbs:
  - create
  - delete
  - get
  - list
  - patch
  - update
  - watch
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: demo-role-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: demo-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: gitopssets-controller-manager
  namespace: flux-system
```
