## ADR == Architecture Decision Records

During meetings, it isn't unusual to make decisions that impact a product's architecture or operation.  While these decisions are frequently captured in the meeting minutes, it is time-consuming and inefficient to wade through meeting minutes looking for those decisions.  Therefore, we will capture them using [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) as it handles numbering, file naming, and filling in the ADR title.  Additionally, it provides tooling for actions like superseding ADRs with newer decisions.  If you prefer, you can use the [ADR template](./adr-template.md) but make sure you follow the numbering and file naming similarly as adr-tools.

The ADR is a lightweight process for documenting these decisions. By storing them in the repository with the code, we will have a record and history.

The concept of ADRs originated in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
